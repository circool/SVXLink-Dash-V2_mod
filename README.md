## Project Relationship Notice

### This is NOT a Replacement
**This project is an independent fork with significant architectural differences** that make it incompatible with the original SVXLink-Dashboard-V2.

### Key Differences:
- ✅ **Complete backend rewrite** - Different technology stack
- ✅ **Redesigned UI** - WSPD-style interface
- ✅ **Independent development path** - Not intended to merge back with original
- ❌ **Not compatible** with original configurations or data
- ❌ **Not a drop-in replacement** for the original dashboard
- ❌ **Separate issue tracking** - Issues should be reported here, not in original repo
